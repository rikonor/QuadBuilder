2) On main page, compress parts list into a tabbed window to allow for more comfortable browsing.

5) Use <iframe>'s for "popup" on hover info screens.

6) Use cookies to save shown spec and reload it again on reentry to the page. You can save in the cookie all of the part id's. Like so: Cookie-content: "Motor:1234,ESC:1456,Prop:1414"
