<b>QuadBuilder</b>

Website found at: http://quad-builder.appspot.com

This website is meant as an online collection of multirotor builds. The aim is for users all across the globe to submit their builds and specs, where other users can watch and rate them.

This website uses Google App Engine and is also meant as an excercise in web-development for me.
I would welcome any input or offers for improvement or even offers to help from anyone interested, so if you are looking to get your hands dirty feel free to send me a message.

-- Edit: 20 Sept., 2013
Lots of changes.
UI has been totally revamped.
Got rid of some of the JS.
Added User signup.
Added connectivity between users and submitted specs/builds.
Check it out!
